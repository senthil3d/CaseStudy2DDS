## Project member name: Senthil Kumar
## Document Name: ReadMe file
## Document Purpose: To provide an overview of the project work done.

## Introduction to the Project for Case Study on Employee Attrition
## Context
The dataset includes features like Age, Employee Role, Daily Rate, Job Satisfaction, Years At Company, Years In Current Role etc. 
For this study, we will try to study the factors that lead to employee attrition. 
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’.

## Objective
DDS-Analytics company consultants helps human resources to interpret data, find out the trends & help take required steps to keep the organization running smoothly & profitably. 
It has helped human resources to be more active and gain involved role in an organization's planning & objectives. 
This notebook uses the case study2 dataset on employees to predict the attrition as well as study the underlying factors & interpret them through visualizations. 
The three classification algorithms - Logistic Regression, k-NN & Leave One Out k-NN have been used to make predictions on attrition.

## DataSets
CaseStudy2-data.csv - Contains dataset on 870 employees with 36 features (variables), used for case study-02 analysis and modelling
CaseStudy2CompSet_No_Attrition.csv - Contains dataset on “Competition Set” for classifying attrition of employees
CaseStudy2CompSet_No_Salary.csv - Contains dataset on “Competition Set” for predicting monthly income of employees

## Approach for the project
The approach taken was to plot & then draw several inferences using the employee dataset in case study2.
The major product of the project work was centered across classifying the employees into attrition or not attrition using the various employee related variables.

## Here is where you can find all sorts of supporting material for this project under my GitHub repository:  
1. RMarkdown (RMD) file, which has all the code used in R language to draw data pre-processing, imputation, plots, model and drawing inferences.
2. Knit HTML file, which has plots and tables to supplement the RMD file in form of nice presentation of the project.
3. Codebook, which kind overview of the R code and serves purpose of a data dictionary.
4. ReadMe.md file, which has the summary of the work done for this project.
5. PPT (Powerpoint) presentation slides, which has all the plots and inferences drawn for the project.
